# Prediction of disease Diabetes
# Problem Statement
 To use all the information to predict the people with diabetes
# Solution  
  The prediction have been performed in the python notebook using following steps-<br />
  1)Import the whole dataset<br />
  2)merge the info and analysis dataset for both training and testing dataset on the basis of id<br />
  3)Next step is to study the data<br />
  4)Find the missing values and invalid data<br />
  5)Convert string values into categorical data<br />
  6)Applying different machine learning algorithms<br />
  7)Compare the algorithms using accuracy score<br />
  8)perform feature bbimportance for the best algorithm(on the basis of accuracy)<br />
  9)Validate the output<br />
  ## How to run the code
  Steps to run the python file<br />
  1)Install the dependencies from requirements.txt<br />
  2)In the python file read change the path of the dataset while reading the dataset<br />
  3)Run the whole pipeline<br />
